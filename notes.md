# Mini Project: Character Generator and Game

Use Cucumber and RSpec to draw out specifications for the application and units.

Also, actually think about what the application is supposed to do.

At the very least, I want to input a name, choose a class, and get a character with randomly generated stats.

I'm having trouble figuring out how to do choices, menu inputs, etc. using Cucumber, or how to get the program to do anything more than passing in arguments. Maybe that's cause I've gone a bit out of scope for this class by doing acceptance/integration testing...I'll stick to unit testing from now on. It's easier.
