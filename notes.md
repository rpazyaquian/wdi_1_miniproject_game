# Mini Project: Character Generator and Game

I want to generate a character that I can later use in a game.

I want to be able to make my own character, i.e. pass stuff in.

I then want to be able to use that character in a really really simple game.

What will a Character object be *doing?*

A Character object will HAVE:

* A name.

A Character object will DO:

* Attack.
* Take damage.
* Heal.

Or something. That works, for now.
